# Quick Locale Tester (FR / DE / JA)

This Streamlit app lets you enter **number, percent, date & time, and currency** once and preview how they render for **fr_FR**, **de_DE**, and **ja_JP**.

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Use
1. Pick a locale from the dropdown.
2. Enter a number, a percent (e.g., 0.1234), a date and time.
3. Enter a currency amount and code (e.g., EUR, JPY).

The app shows locale-specific **decimal, percent, currency, date, time, and datetime** outputs, plus quick **style notes** for FR/DE/JA.
